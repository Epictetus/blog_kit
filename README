Setup
=====

BlogKit is designed to work with your existing user model, at the moment, it assumes this will be
called User.  Your User class and application controller simply need to respond to some methods to
be able to use BlogKit.  These methods, while not standardized are very common, and come with plugins
like Authlogic and restful_authentication.

ApplicationController should respond to:
#require_user
#current_user

User model should respond to:
#admin?  - returns true if the user can edit posts and delete comments
#name	 - the users name
#blog_image_url (optional)
#email (options - for gravatar support)

Requirements
============

Rails 2.3.x (Rails 3 support coming soon)

- Ultraviolet (and its deps)
- Will_Paginate
